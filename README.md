# Introduction to ChIP-seq analysis

Welcome in this tutorial, you will find here a detailed ChIP-seq workflow, starting from sequencing read to the final coverage tracks and differentially accessible genomic regions.

This tutorial is using the Galaxy platform to perform the data download, quality control, mapping and peak calling. We will then explore the result via IGV and RSAT.

## 1. A brief note on ChIP-seq

ChIP-seq stands for **Ch**romatin **I**mmuno **P**recipitation followed by **seq**uencing.

## 2. A brief note on Galaxy

Today, we will work on the Galaxy platform. It's simple, free and open-source.

## 3. Let's start the analysis : downloading the data

We will work on the study from X et al.
[ADD STUDY DETAILS]

Upon publication of their work, authors should deposit their raw data on a publicly available repositories. You can access and download these archives via two main platforms, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) from NCBI (US) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) from EBI (EU). Both platforms regularly cross-update each other.

To find the correct accession ID in a study, you should look for the following :
* A **BioProject accession**, starting with `PRJ` (*e.g.* `PRJNA176146`), that will link to the complete project archive
* A **GEO identifier**, starting with `GSE` (*e.g.* `GSE41186`), that will link to a specific experiments, in our case ChIP-seq.

⚡️ Your turn : Find the accession identifiers for raw sequencing data from X et al.

  You are looking for a code starting with `GSE`. You usually find it in the *Data accessibility* section of an article, else you can try to `Ctrl+F` for `GSE` in the paper.

## 4. Quality Checking

We need to assess the quality of the sequencing reads.
